# NodeJS-Express API for CRUD Database Operations

## CRUD: Create-Read-Update-Delete

1. Connects to a database
2. Creates the payload: 
{ message: String, data: Object }
This means you are to return an object containing a message that tells the client if the request is successful or not, and data object containing your result.
If there's an error in the request, the response should return the error message instead.
3. Gets the data created
4. Updates the data created
5. Deletes the data created

<b>The data you are required to create should contain name, email and country</b>
